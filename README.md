## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| PORT | Port for the server to listen on | 3000 | No |
| DUMBKAN_PIN | PIN code required to access the application | None | No |
| DUMB_SECRET | Secret key for API authorization via X-API-Key header | None | No |
| SITE_TITLE | Title displayed in the header and browser tab | DumbKan | No |
| BASE_URL | Base URL path for the application (e.g., '/app') | - | No |

## PIN Protection
When `DUMBKAN_PIN` is set, the app requires PIN verification before accessing or modifying boards. The PIN must be 4-10 digits long.

## Data Persistence
Task data is stored in `/app/dumbdata/tasks.json`. When using Docker, mount this directory as a volume to persist data between container restarts.

## Data Migration
This version contains significant changes to the data structure. If you're upgrading from an earlier version:

- The application will automatically detect old data files in legacy locations (e.g., `/app/data/tasks.json`)
- Data will be automatically migrated to the new structure and stored in `/app/dumbdata/tasks.json`
- A backup of your old data will be created at the original location with a timestamp
- No manual steps are required for this migration

### Data Structure Changes
- The data model has been normalized with separate collections for boards, sections, and tasks
- Columns are now called "sections" and have unique IDs
- Tasks have more metadata: priority, status, due dates, etc.
- This new structure improves performance and enables future features
